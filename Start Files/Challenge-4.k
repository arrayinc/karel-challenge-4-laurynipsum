/* File: Challenge-4.k
 ---------------------------
Generalize the program you wrote in Challenge 3 so that Karel
is able to climb a stair-step mountain of any height and place
a flag on its top.

Thus, in addition to climbing the mountain in that exercise,
it should be able to scale a molehill or Mount Everest.
